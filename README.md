# Stocks-News

I built this app because wanted to learn more about how the stock market was affected by major events, but couldn't find an online tool that would simply show me relevant headlines for a given company at specific dates alongside stock market data. Stock data and news articles are fetched from IEX and New York Times API's respectively.
